## Background

### Command: gnote day

I have been using Obsidian through neovim. I make a new daily note each morning to track what I'm doing, what needs to be done next, etc. I store these notes in my Obsidian vault so they can be searched later.

### Command: gnote ticket

We use Jira at work and each time I pull a new ticket, I make a note folder to track my investigation, things I've done, things I'm going to do, etc. Doing this helps me when I get interrupted mid-feature and then come back to the ticket. When I have good notes, I find it easier to deal with having lots of unfinished tickets.
